# YOLOv9-LicensePlateDetect

#Overview
This project aims to develop a robust license plate detection system using computer vision techniques and deep learning models. The system will be capable of accurately detecting license plates in images or video streams, providing a valuable tool for various applications such as vehicle tracking, parking management, and law enforcement.

Features
License Plate Localization: Utilizes state-of-the-art object detection algorithms to precisely locate license plates within images or video frames.
Character Recognition: Implements optical character recognition (OCR) techniques to extract text from detected license plates.
Real-time Processing: Designed for real-time processing, enabling fast and efficient detection of license plates in live video streams.
Scalability: Built with scalability in mind, allowing easy integration with existing systems and adaptation to different environments and scenarios.
Customizable: Provides options for fine-tuning parameters and adapting the system to specific use cases or requirements.
User-friendly Interface: Offers a user-friendly interface for easy interaction and integration into other projects or applications.
